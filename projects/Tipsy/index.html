            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Tipsy is a team project aimed at designing an integrated application for users who wish to purchase liquors online and make cocktails on their own. We want to help our users to easily access to alcohol-related items and knowledges by creating a platform that provides comprehensive products and services.</p>
            
            <h1>Domain Research</h1>
                <p>According to an industry research firm from The International Wine and Spirits Record, alcohol delivery service is a rapidly developing market that became particularly popular  after the pandemic, they predicts <span style="font-weight: bold;">“the alcohol eCommerce market will still increase by 42% this year (2021) to reach $24 billion.”</span></p>
                <p>According to Drizly’s report, there are also some engaging trends in this area that could create more marketplaces. For example, “products for health-conscious shoppers increased by 57%, at a time when 90% of retailers on Drizly now stock non-alcoholic beer, wine, and other alternatives, and share of such products on Drizly are up 120% since 2020”. On the other hand, there is also a trend that combines alcohol delivery with other features like groceries and cocktails.</p>
                <p>Against the backdrop of the growing popularity of home entertainment in the post-pandemic era, our goal is to seize new growth opportunities in the liquor delivery market and win in the fierce competition for products.</p>
